            <h4>Written Questions</h4>
            <li>
            Graph 1:
            I put the number of titles per genre on Netflix into a bar graph. The view was limited to 9 genres at a time, sorted from greatest to least, so that the data was easier to view. 
            <br/> Graph 2:
            Average runtime of movies by release year was answered by averaging the runtime of movies during each release year, and putting it into a bar graph. Yet again the number of entires was limited to make the data more readable.
        <br/>Graph 3:
            For this question, I made the flowchart where each actor was a circular node and each line connected the actors. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                1. D3 was useful because it made styling graphs quite easy; rather than manually editing HTML shapes, it does this for us which
                made things a lot simpler.
                <br/>2. D3 was interactive, and made it possible to handle graph interactions and updates without having to manually delete or add shapes, text, etc.
                <br/>3. It was fairly easy to make graphs; once one was made, other similar ones were quite straightforward.
            </li>
            <li> 1. D3 was not the fastest when there was a large amount of data. Because there is a lot of math involved in some graphs, 
                for instance in my flowchart graph, the browser is overloaded and has trouble keeping up.
                <br/>2. There are some constraings with D3, for instance the data needs to be preprocessed very specifically and this may be difficult
                or slow in some circumstances
                <br/>3. It is not particularly easy to style elements in D3 since the .attr() must be used rather than pure CSS; this makes styling
                much more tedious and also decreases code readability. 
            </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                    <h4>Ethical Questions</h4>
                    <li>
                    Those with hearing impairments would find this dashboard accessible, since no sound is used. Those with visual impairments may not find
                    this page accessible, since it reuqires mousing over or clicking on buttons to see labels/alter the data. These are good features 
                    for a user without disabilities, however for those who find it difficult to click on menus or buttons, or view smaller text, this dashboard
                    is not ideal. It would be better to have all data displayed as a default, rather than having data or labels appear when the mouse hovers
                    over the data point as in my third graph. In addition, voice over capabilities could be added to the graph; with D3 graphs, it would take
                    some additional work to make sure that the data was also displayed in a way that could be accessed by those with visual impairments.
                    </li>
                <li>
                    During the design impelmentation stage, one reason that I took steps that may not have been ideal for those with disabilities was becuase of 
                    the way in which D3 is set up. It would've been somewhat hard to display shapes in the most accessible possible way. In addition, adding
                    more accessible elements would often mean decreasing functionality of the graph or making it less visually appealing to those without 
                    visual impairments; this is not fair, though, to those with disabilities and should be used as an excuse. In addition, the Assignment
                    specification made me want to add functionality (such as hover titles) which I may not have done if these were not the requirements.
